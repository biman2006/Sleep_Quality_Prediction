# Sleep_Quality_Prediction
This is a Machine learning model that predict sleep quality of a person based on several features

📌 Project Overview

This project predicts Sleep Quality using lifestyle and health-related features.
The goal is to understand how factors like sleep duration, physical activity, stress level, BMI, heart rate, and daily steps affect sleep quality.

The model is built using Linear Regression with multiple data transformation techniques to improve performance.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – data handling

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning (Linear Regression)

📊 Dataset

Dataset contains health and lifestyle information

Features include:

Sleep Duration

Physical Activity Level

Stress Level

BMI Category

Heart Rate

Daily Steps

Target variable: Sleep Quality

🔍 Data Preprocessing & Transformation

The following steps were performed:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)

Log and power transformations (where required)

Train-test split


🤖 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Linear Regression

Why Linear Regression?

Simple and interpretable

Good baseline model for regression problems

Model trained on transformed features for better accuracy

📈 Model Evaluation

Model performance was evaluated using:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualizations were used to compare actual vs predicted sleep quality.
